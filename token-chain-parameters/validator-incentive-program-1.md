# Validator Incentive Program (from 01-10-2023)

The BitCanna chain is supporting the network and the services of BitCanna. Currently 100 validators are securing our blockchain. To reward validators doing more than just validating, but are also offering services to BitCanna we have started a Validator Incentive Program (VIP). Across various categories ranging from technical services to marketing and educational services validators can earn team delegations. This page shows the various categories recognized for the services, how the size of the delegation is determined, how we go about with new rounds of delegations and who has received a delegation in the current round of the VIP (which validator, which service and which size).

### Categories recognized as services for BitCanna

The services we recognize are described below. Per category the description of the service is given and the prerequisite we use to assess eligibility. Services can be rewarded for testnet and mainnet services separately.

  * Prerequisite: accessible URL, tx-index = on, node needs to be synced. Note; these should not be run from your validator node for security reasons.
  * Obtained from: [Github](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/bitcanna/chain.json)
* Seednodes
  * Description: providing an seednode used by other nodes to find peers

  * Prerequisite: -
  * Obtained from: Google Form for validator submissions

### Determining the delegation amount

All services will be checked on the mentioned prerequisites. All services are ranked with either a simple ‚ÄúYes / No‚Äù (for example for RPC nodes, statesync; things which either work or don‚Äôt work) or are ranked in 3 levels, namely ‚ÄúSmall / Medium / Large‚Äù based on the audience the service has (for example for explorers and wallets). And lastly we have introduced a level of delegations for new innovation, which will be given to validators who are in the start-up phase of their service which are looking promising or to complete new type of services which are completely different from other services.

For our current delegation program running from June 2023, we have in total a delegation budget of 36 million BCNA for all the categories (note: due to some corrections after the delegations were done this amount is increased to 36.15 million BCNA). A couple of these get a fixed fee:

* Snapshots (150k BCNA delegation)
* Statesync (40k BCNA delegation)
* Archive nodes (750k BCNA delegation)
* RPC nodes (40k BCNA delegation)
* Relayers (200k BCNA delegation per channel)

After substracting the delegation amount required to reward these services, we distribute the remaining delegation budget over the rest of the services. This is done by giving points for each service. A ‚ÄúYes‚Äù gets 1 point, a ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù gets 0.5 point, a ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù gets 1 point, a ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù gets 1.5 point and the Innovation tag gets 0.1 point. In our current execution 1 point is worth a delegation of 216462.59 BCNA. This means that:

* A "Yes" gets a delegation of 216462.59 BCNA
* A ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù gets a delegation of 108231.29 BCNA
* A ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù gets a delegation of 216462.59 BCNA
* A ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù gets a delegation of 324693.88 BCNA
* ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù gets a delegation of 21646.26 BCNA

### New delegations

Every 4 months (so 3 times per year; in January, May and September) we will review the delegations given. During this period we will also open up the form again, to allow validators with services to subscribe to the program. We will communicate this via our social channels as well as via the validator chats on Discord.

The input received will be assessed and included in the program if approved. Results for the most recent round can be found below.

Note that the amount of $BCNA per earned point can change based on the amount of service providers. So even though your services offered might remain the same, the delegation amount can go up (a bit) or down (a bit) based on the total amount of points rewarded for the services offered by all validators.
