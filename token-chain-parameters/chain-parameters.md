# Chain Parameters

### **Inflation**

Don't know how inflation parameters work?[ **This article**](https://figment.io/resources/cosmos-inflation-staking-rewards-how-are-they-related/) explains it for Cosmos' blockchain.

* Inflation initial = 2.8% per year&#x20;
* Inflation minimum = 2.8%&#x20;
* Inflation maximum = 10%
* Inflation change rate = 10%&#x20;
* Bonded goal = 67%

Inflation is infinite until decided otherwise by on-chain governance. This means that the larger your stake is in the BitCanna network, the more say you have in changing the chain parameters by voting. This is a big change in regards to our previous network; 420M is practically no longer the MAX supply, but theoretically could be as a result of on-chain voting.

### **Staking**

Don’t know what staking is? Head [**here**](../concepts-and-terminology/staking.md).

* Unbonding time = 14 days&#x20;
* Max validators = 100
* Gas price = 0.001ubcna**\***

### **Slashing**

Don’t know what slashing is? Head [**here**](../concepts-and-terminology/slashing.md).

* Jailing after failing to sign blocks for consecutively = 24 hours&#x20;
* Balance slashing for downtime = 0.5%&#x20;
* Balance slashing for double signing = 5%&#x20;
* Jail duration = 600 seconds
